T = table(time,outflowpH,conductivity,waterCon,caliCON,concentration, nschange, i/ma, capacity/mah, capacity);

time -> pH data
outflowpH -> pH data


conductivity -> conductivity data

caliCON -> calculated from concentration data ->readConFile.m

concentration -> readCONCFile.m

nschange -> EC data
i/ma -> EC data
capacity/mah -> EC data


capacity -> readECFile.m



waterCon -> calculated from pH data  -> readpHfile.m
